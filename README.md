# CUBE3D
Inspired by Wolfenstein3D, this project goal was to render a "3D" dynamic view of a maze by casting rays. Wolfenstein3D, used "rays" to create a first-person shooter experience in a 2D environment, simulating a 3D view by projecting rays from the player's perspective to determine the visible walls and objects in the game. The "ray caster" gives the illusion of depth and perspective without using actual 3D models, allowing for fast and efficient rendering on early computer hardware.
